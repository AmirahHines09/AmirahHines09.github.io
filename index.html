     <h2> The Life of Tupac Amaru Shakur </h2>  
     <p>Tupac Amaru Shakur was born Lesane Parish Crooks on June 16, 1971, in New York Cityâ€™s Harlem neighborhood. His mother, Afeni Shakur, had been a political activist and Black Panther Party member who was arrested in 1969 for allegedly planning coordinated attacks on police stations and offices in New York City. She became pregnant with Tupac while out on bail, and she was acquitted in 1971 after defending herself in court.</p>
